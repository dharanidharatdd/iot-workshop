# IoT Workshop

# Note: If you want to play around with this code, go through the project once and understand it.
# Make sure you add 

## Firebase Configurations to add:
  1. Realtime Database
  2. Authentication
  3. Storage

## I will be removing my API's from this code, so make sure to clone it and host it your self using github-pages.
To configure Firebase for this project, use the following configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  databaseURL: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  measurementId: ""
};
```

To get this configuration from Firebase:
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create or select your project.
3. Navigate to Project Settings.
4. Under the General tab, you will find your Firebase SDK snippet. Copy the configuration settings into your project.
